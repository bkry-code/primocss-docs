Title: Spacing

----

Text: 

##Vertical alignment

Using the lobotomised owl selector, this allows you to control the flow of content. Each element which follows another will be applied with ```margin-top``` to define spacing equally. This system should anticipate spacing instead of setting specifics. In styles elements can be set as well to remove the ```margin``` as they do not require any margin at all, this should override the global vertical rhythm.

In other areas of PrimoCSS the vertical rhythm has been set. Styles can be found in [_layout.spacing.scss](https://github.com/primocss/primocss/blob/master/scss/_layout.spacing.scss).

######Example

```scss
* {
    margin: 0;

    + *,
    + h1,
    + fieldset  {
      margin-top: $global-spacing-unit; 
    }
  }

  body,
  main,
  br,
  li,
  dt,
  dd,
  th,
  td,
  option {
    margin: 0;
  }
```
