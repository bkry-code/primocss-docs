## Hotlink

If you just need to include the latest compiled version of the PrimoCSS Framework, use our hosted version to begin your project.

######Example

```html
<link href="http://primocss.com/build/css/primocss.min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" type="text/css">
```

Now you're all done, your site or project has PrimoCSS at its core and you can start to build simple but effective responsive designs. Follow on reading for our basic HTML template.

### Basic template

######Example
 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

        <link href="http://primocss.com/build/css/primocss.min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" type="text/css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Local development

If you would like to help and improve this project in anyway or use the project and develop on it locally follow these commands to help. Start by [downloading via GitHub](https://github.com/primocss/primocss/archive/master.zip) or git cloning the project ```git clone git@github.com:primocss/primocss.git```.

Development requires the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). To setup, here is a list of commands to help you get started:

######Example

``` bash
npm install
gulp build
```

Once complete open the ```build``` folder to see the newly created CSS. You can override any of the global settings for PrimoCSS via [_settings.defaults.scss](https://github.com/primocss/primocss/blob/master/scss/_settings.defaults.scss) and [_settings.colors.scss](https://github.com/primocss/primocss/blob/master/scss/_settings.colors.scss). Any new SCSS created can be tested by running the gulp linter and keeps all styles in check

######Example

```bash
gulp test
```
