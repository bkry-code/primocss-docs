Title: Box sizing

----

Text: 

PrimoCSS sets simple sizing for the framework, creating a global ```boz-sizing``` by globally setting the value as ```border-box```. This will make sure any new patterns or styles aren't effected by ```padding```.  This is set on the ```<html>``` element and any psudeo elements such as ```:before``` and ```:after``` will inherit it's parent styles.

To globally turn off the box sizing, set ```$global-border-box``` to ```false``` in any overwrite file. Styles can be found in [_global.box-sizing.scss](https://github.com/primocss/primocss/blob/master/scss/_global.box-sizing.scss) and [_settings.default.scss](https://github.com/primocss/primocss/blob/master/scss/_settings.defaults.scss).

######Example

```scss
@if $global-border-box == true {
  // GENERIC - Box sizing

  //
  //  All elements set as 'border-box'. Overwrite this on a
  //  class by class or element basis.
  //

  html {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  * {
    box-sizing: inherit;

    &::before,
    &::after {
      box-sizing: inherit;
    }
  }
}
```
