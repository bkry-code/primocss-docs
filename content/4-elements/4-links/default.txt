Title: Links

Text: 

## Hyperlink / anchor tag

PrimoCSS sets all link styles to inherit colours from its parent unless set. Links can be styled using the ```link-style``` mixin and any global changes can be found at [_elements.link.scss](https://github.com/primocss/primocss/blob/master/scss/_elements.links.scss). All links are distinguished by ```text-dectoration: underline``` and uses ```$color-blue-light``` as the ```:hover``` style.

######Example

<div class="box box--panel">
<a href="#">Example anchor link</a>
</div>

```html
<a href="#">...</a>
```
